# build_MyAnimeList_api

Choose an anime database API: There are several anime databases available online, such as MyAnimeList, AniList, and Kitsu. Choose one that suits your needs and create an account to obtain an API key.

Install necessary dependencies: You will need to install the following Node.js modules:

npm install express axios dotenv


Create a .env file: Create a new file named .env in your project directory and add the following lines:

ANIME_API_KEY=<your anime API key>

This code creates an Express app and sets up a route to handle requests for anime information. When a GET request is made to /anime/:id, where :id is the ID of the anime, the app sends a request to the anime API and returns the anime information as a JSON response.

Start the server: Run the following command in your terminal to start the server:

node index.js


You can now test your API by making a GET request to http://localhost:3000/anime/:id, where :id is the ID of the anime you want to get information for.
